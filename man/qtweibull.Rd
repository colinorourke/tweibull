\title{Quantile Function for Truncated Weibull}
\usage{
qtweibull(p, shape, scale, a = 0, b = Inf, log.p = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{(Numeric) Vector of probabilities}

\item{shape}{(Numeric) Vector of Weibull shape parameters (default: 0)}

\item{scale}{(Numeric) Vector of Weibull scale parameters (default: Inf)}

\item{a}{(Numeric) Vector of lower truncation points}

\item{b}{(Numeric) Vector of upper truncation points}

\item{log.p}{(Logical) Whether p represents p or \eqn{log(p)} (default: FALSE)}

\item{...}{Currently does nothing}
}
\value{
(Numeric) vector of quantile function values
}
\description{
This is an attempt to provide a more numerically stable
version of the truncated Weibull distribution, especially
for more extreme truncation points. Underneith the hood it
relies on \code{uniroot}, which may issue errors. For this reason \code{qtweibull}
should be considered the least stable component of this package.
It's also about 50 times slower than \code{stats::qweibull} in cases
where they both apply.
